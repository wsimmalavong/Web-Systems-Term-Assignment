Additional Details

I tasks were specifically creating a group report that would manage everyone's workload and required deadlines. This was created to ensure that everyone's tasks were up to par with the projects requirements. As a group we all implemented the front-end framework of Semantic UI. I was the team member that was responsible for all of the back-end applications. On the website the menu, home, pages 1,2 and 6 were created by myself and my team members were responsible for the other pages with the exception of animations which were assisted with my help.
